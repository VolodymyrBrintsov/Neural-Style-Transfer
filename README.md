# Neural-Style-Transfer

We take two images—a content image and a style reference image 
(such as an artwork by a famous painter) — and blend them together 
so the output image looks like the content image, but painted in the 
style of the style reference image.

### You can see how Neural Network created new painted image in `Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb`
